A.

​	when n is odd:

​		
$$
s_2 = s_1 - (n * 8 + 24)
$$
​	when n is even:
$$
s_2 = s_1 - (n * 8 + 16)
$$
B.

​	
$$
p = (s_2 + 15)\&0XFFFFFFF0
$$
​	the least multiple of 16 that greater than s2

C.

| which    | e1   | n    | s1      |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| least    | 1    | even | n%16==1 |
| greatest | 24   | odd  | n%16==0 |

D.

​	p is aligned by 16

​	s2 is the least multiple of 16 that preserve 8*n size space
